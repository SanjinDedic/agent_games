# Creating a New Game for agent_games

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new game for the agent_games project. By following these steps, you'll be able to implement a game that integrates seamlessly with the existing framework.

## 1. Create the Game Directory

First, create a new directory for your game inside the `games` folder. Name it after your game, using snake_case. Create two directories as well for testing out the league on submission.

```
agent_games/
└── games/
    └── your_game_name/
    └── leagues/
        └── test_league/
```

## 2. Implement the Game Class

Create a new Python file in your game directory, named after your game (e.g., `your_game_name.py`). In this file, implement your game class, which should inherit from `BaseGame`.

```python
from games.base_game import BaseGame
import random

class YourGameName(BaseGame):
    starter_code = '''
# Provide starter code for players here
'''

    game_instructions = '''
# Provide HTML-formatted game instructions here
'''

    def __init__(self, league, verbose=False):
        super().__init__(league, verbose)
        # Initialize game-specific attributes here

    def play_round(self):
        # Implement the logic for a single round of the game

    def get_game_state(self):
        # Return the current state of the game

    def play_game(self, custom_rewards=None):
        # Implement the full game logic
        # Return the results in the format: {"points": points, "score_aggregate": scores}

    def assign_points(self, scores, custom_rewards=None):
        # Implement the point assignment logic

    def reset(self):
        super().reset()
        # Reset any game-specific attributes

def run_simulations(num_simulations, league, custom_rewards=None):
    return BaseGame.run_simulations(num_simulations, YourGameName, league, custom_rewards)
```

Ensure that you implement all the required methods, including `play_round`, `get_game_state`, `play_game`, `assign_points`, and `reset`.

## 3. Create the Player Class

Create a `player.py` file in your game directory to define the base `Player` class for your game.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Player(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        # Initialize any player-specific attributes

    @abstractmethod
    def make_decision(self, game_state):
        pass
    
    # Add any helper methods that players might need
```

## 4. Update the Game Factory

Update the `game_factory.py` file in the `games` directory to include your new game:

```python
from games.greedy_pig.greedy_pig import GreedyPigGame
from games.forty_two.forty_two import FortyTwoGame
from games.your_game_name.your_game_name import YourGameName

class GameFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_game_class(game_name):
        if game_name == "greedy_pig":
            return GreedyPigGame
        elif game_name == "forty_two":
            return FortyTwoGame
        elif game_name == "your_game_name":
            return YourGameName
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown game: {game_name}")
```

## 5. Add Bots on Test League

Inside the test_league folder of your game. Add adversary examples that will against the submitted code. The results against them would be displayed on submission page. If none is added then the submitted code will always win in test league.

## 6. Add Game-Specific Files

If your game requires any additional files (e.g., game assets, configuration files), add them to your game directory.

## 7. Testing Your Game

Create test files for your game in the `tests` directory. At minimum, you should have:

- `test_your_game_name.py`: Unit tests for your game logic
- Update `test_api_sim.py` to include tests for your game's API integration

## 8. Documentation

Update the project documentation to include information about your new game:

- Add a section in the README.md file describing your game
- Update any relevant API documentation
- If necessary, create a separate markdown file with detailed game rules and strategies

By following these steps, you'll create a new game that integrates well with the existing agent_games framework. Remember to maintain consistency with the existing code style and structure throughout your implementation.
