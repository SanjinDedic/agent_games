# Arena Champions â€” concise rules and RPS matchup

### Overview
- 2 players face off in turn-based combat.
- Competition format is a leauge where each player fights every other player twice (home and away).
- Stats (self.attack_proportion etc...) are chosen once at the beginning (before matches start).
- Actions ("attack", "precise attack" etc ..) are chosen each turn/round during a battle.

### Step 1: Assign Attributes 
First assign attribute proportions (each is between 0.2 and 0.4, total adds up to 1.0):
- `attack_proportion`: increases attack damage
- `defense_proportion`: increases damage reduction
- `max_health_proportion`: increases total HP (more HP = harder to KO)
- `dexterity_proportion`: increases dodge chance and precision


### Step 2: Combat Actions
Each turn, one player is the attacker and the other is the defender.
- Attacker can choose: attack, big_attack, precise_attack
- Defender can choose: defend, dodge, brace

### What you can see on your turn
- You are told your role this turn: `attacker` or `defender`.
- `opponent_stats` is always available (attack, defense, dexterity, health, max_health).
- `last_opponent_action` shows what your opponent did on their previous turn only.
    - You cannot see what they choose this turn; decisions are simultaneous for the round.
    - Example: as attacker you do not see the defender's current defense choice.


### Matchup table
```
------------------------------------------------
|                | defend  |  brace  |  dodge  |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| attack         | neutral |  weak   | strong  |
| big_attack     | strong  | neutral |  weak   |
| precise_attack |  weak   | strong  | neutral |
------------------------------------------------
```

### Notes
- Dodge can fully avoid hits (chance scales with dexterity).
- Big attack deals double damage but costs 50% of your current HP + 15 HP.
- Precise attack is more effective against bracing defenders and scales with dexterity.
- Each win can level up your stats in their chosen proportions.
