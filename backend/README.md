## üåü Overview
The Multi-Game Simulation Platform is a Python-based project that allows users to simulate and play various games, starting with the popular dice game, Greedy Pig. The platform has been expanded to support multiple games and includes a front-end interface for enhanced user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with the Multi-Game Simulation Platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-game-simulation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the database by running the database initialization script: `python initialize_db.py`
4. Start the FastAPI server: `uvicorn api:app --reload`
5. Access the platform through the provided front-end interface.

## üé≤ Available Games
- Greedy Pig: A simple dice game with interesting and unpredictable dynamics.
- Forty-Two: A card game where players aim to get as close to 42 points as possible without going over.

For more information on Greedy Pig, check out these resources:

## üìö Game Creation Guide
For collaborators interested in creating new games for the platform, please refer to our [Game Creation Guide](games/game_instructions.md). This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement and integrate a new game into the existing framework.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `api.py`: The main FastAPI application file that handles API endpoints and request handling.
- `auth.py`: Contains authentication-related functions and utilities.
- `config.py`: Stores configuration variables and settings for the project.
- `database.py`: Handles database operations and interactions.
- `models_db.py` and `models_api.py`: Define the database models and API schemas used in the project.
- `games/`: A directory that contains game-specific files and implementations.
  - `base_game.py`: The base class for all games.
  - `game_factory.py`: Factory class for creating game instances.
  - `greedy_pig/`: The Greedy Pig game implementation.
  - `forty_two/`: The Forty-Two game implementation.
- `validation.py`: Contains validation functions for agent code and simulations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## üåê API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available:

- `/`: Root endpoint for testing server status.
- `/league_create`: Creates a new league.
- `/league_join/{link}`: Allows users to join a league using a specific link.
- `/admin_login`: Handles admin login and authentication.
- `/team_login`: Handles team login and authentication.
- `/team_create`: Creates a new team (admin only).
- `/submit_agent`: Submits an agent code for a specific team.
- `/run_simulation`: Runs a simulation for a specific league (admin only).
- `/get_all_admin_leagues`: Retrieves all admin leagues.
- `/league_assign`: Assigns a team to a league.
- `/delete_team`: Deletes a team (admin only).
- `/get_all_teams`: Retrieves all teams.
- `/get_all_league_results`: Retrieves results for a specific league (admin only).
- `/publish_results`: Publishes simulation results for a league (admin only).
- `/get_published_results_for_league`: Retrieves published results for a specific league.
- `/get_published_results_for_all_leagues`: Retrieves published results for all leagues.
- `/update_expiry_date`: Updates the expiry date for a league (admin only).
- `/get_game_instructions`: Retrieves instructions for a specific game.

## üîí Security Features
The platform includes the following security features:

- Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Password hashing using the `bcrypt` algorithm.
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent script injection and unauthorized access.
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware for secure cross-origin requests.

## üåê Front-end Interface
The platform includes a user-friendly front-end interface built with modern web technologies. The front-end communicates with the FastAPI backend through API requests and provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the platform, create and join leagues, submit agents, and view simulation results.

## üîß Customization and Expansion
The Multi-Game Simulation Platform is designed to be easily customizable and expandable. You can add new games by following the steps outlined in the [Game Creation Guide](games/game_instructions.md).
